#INSTRUCTIONS

1. Cook rice or quinoa according to pack instructions or simply use a precooked pack from the supermarket.
2. Boil the kettle and pour into a bowl to cover and thaw the frozen edamame/peas.
3. Chop the tempeh/tofu or mushrooms into bite size pieces. Finely chop the garlic, scallions, ginger and chilli (removing the seeds from chilli before chopping if you prefer less heat).
4. Heat a medium size non stick pan over high heat. Once hot add the garlic, ginger, chilli and scallion to the pan, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the Tempeh/Tofu or mushrooms and cook for 3-4 minutes, add the tamari and cook for a further 1 minute until the tamari has completely reduced. Ensure to keep the tempeh/ tofu moving so that it cooks on all sides. Set aside.
5. Carefully cut the avocado in half, remove the stone and scoop the avocado from the skin onto a board, slice to desired thickness.
6. Peel and dice the mango
7. Peel the carrot, then using the peeler, peel into long thin strips. Drain the edamame/peas.
8. To build your Poke bowl, divide the rice/quinoa between the 2 bowls, do the same with Tempeh/Tofu or mushrooms, leaving enough room to display nicely all your other components. Add the avocado, carrots, edamame/peas, mango between the bowls and garnish with a sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds, and fresh lime or lemon juice. Enjoy!
9. Beat the bloat: replace the garlic with the green part of 1 spring onion.
